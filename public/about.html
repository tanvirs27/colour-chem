                    It was the year of 1973 when our Managing Director Mr. Mizanur Rahman, a postgraduate in Chemistry,
                    came into the business of Dyes &amp; Chemicals under a multinational dyestuff company of
                    France.<br /><br />Colour Chem-Chem Limited, the core company of Colour Chem Group led by its founder &amp;
                    Managing Director - Mr. Mizanur Rahman, made its official debut for service to Bangladesh textile
                    industry back in 1984. <br /><br />The growth of Bangladesh textile industry started after 1985.
                    Since then, we engaged our efforts for world-wide sourcing of modern &amp; technically advanced
